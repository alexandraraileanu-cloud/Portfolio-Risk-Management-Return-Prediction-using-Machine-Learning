#  Portfolio Return Prediction & Risk Management using Machine Learning

This project develops a complete Machine Learning system to **predict portfolio returns** and **analyze investment risk**, combining financial theory with data science techniques.

>  Important: The project (notebook, comments, and report) is written in **Spanish**, but this README is provided in English for accessibility.

---

##  Project Overview

The objective of this project is to design a predictive system capable of:

- Forecasting **daily portfolio returns**
- Analyzing **risk-adjusted performance**
- Supporting **investment decision-making**

The system uses **historical financial data (synthetic but statistically realistic)** and applies **supervised Machine Learning models** to identify patterns and generate predictions.

---

##  Key Features

- 📊 Generation of a synthetic financial dataset based on **Geometric Brownian Motion**
- 📉 Calculation of **technical indicators** (moving averages, momentum, volatility, RSI, etc.)
- 🤖 Training and comparison of **10 Machine Learning models**
- 🌳 Final model selection using **Random Forest**
- 🔁 Time-series **cross-validation**
- 📈 Financial risk metrics:
  - Sharpe Ratio
  - Value at Risk (VaR 95%)
  - Maximum Drawdown
- 💡 Investment decision support based on predicted returns
